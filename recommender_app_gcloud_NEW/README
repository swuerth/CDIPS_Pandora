This is the newer version of the web app that is not yet working!
Feel free to debug!

Follow these instructions to get it working:

Hey dudes -- you should be able to run this app locally if you follow these steps:
From within the recommender_app_gcloud directory, type this in the command line:
source env/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

Then you should be in a virtual environment "env" that runs python 2.
and the next line will install all the packages required to run this app

Now MAKE SURE you have these DataFrame files in this folder:
LyricsDF_with_BoW_tdif_sparse
CosDis_tfidf_reduced
ElenasRelevantSongs

If you don't have them, use this google drive link to a folder called "DF_for_recommender":
https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B8TqvogLXwZrWGdBU2NwV3dNYzg

Then type:
python main.py
And if it works, you should be able to navigate your browser to:
http://127.0.0.1:33508/
