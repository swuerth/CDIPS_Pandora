## CDIPS Summer Data Science Workshop

### For this project we created a music recommender application that uses either Echo Nest audio features or Musixmatch lyrics features. The app is deployed at http://musicrecommendercdips.appspot.com/ and it can be found in the recommender_app_gcloud_NEW directory.

### Many of the ipython notebooks here were used to get data from the Billboard 100 lists, musixmatch, and Echo Nest, and to clean the data up for use in the recommender app.


### Project Description:
### Evolution of Music (Claire Dorman @ Pandora):  
> In my project, students will explore the evolution of hit music through time series analysis of the Billboard chart archives. There are a few different paths the project could take, depending on the interests of the students. For instance, they could use natural language processing on the lyrics of the top-charting songs, using pre-processed lyrics from the MusixMatch dataset, to understand how listeners' musical mood preferences change over the course of a year. Alternatively, they could explore how the stability of the Hot 100 list has changed over the last decade. As on-demand streaming has replaced album sales and social media ensures that ever-larger communities become quickly aware of the same popular culture trends, do our favorite tracks remain so for a longer or shorter period of time than, say, 10 years ago? In either project, students could also explore musicological tags from the EchoNest dataset to identify any musical features that are exceptionally stable or variable over time.
